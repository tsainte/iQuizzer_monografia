With the increasing development of mobility and ubiquity, a large number of web applications have been developed, where \emph{iOS} and \emph{Android} mobile platforms were ones of the most featured technologies when this paper was written. Meanwhile, many distributed resources are combined using techniques and specific prganizations, such as service-oriented architectures. To illustrate, some popular social networks like \emph{Twitter} and \emph {Foursquare}, have communication interfaces based on the use of \emph{REST} to export functionalities, as services to other applications.

This paper aims to present a study which shows the development of a web application that integrates \emph{iOS} and \emph{Android} applications to a \emph{RESTful} web application. To conduct the study, it created a small social network to create quizzes using \emph{Ruby on Rails} and a service PaaS like \emph{Heroku}.
